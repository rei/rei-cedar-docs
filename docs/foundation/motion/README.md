## Overview

Cedar provides easy-to-use, preset values to apply consistent motion for components. Motion tokens help maintain a cohesive experience across all REI properties by:
- Stores motion attributes for duration or timing using variable names, not hard-coded values such as cubic-bezier (0.15, 0, 0.15, 0)
- Specifies a hierarchical and semantically-defined system

<hr>  

Motion tokens are primarily used with web applications. Motion tokens for mobile devices are not currently available.


### Duration
- Animated components use short time durations so interactions feel responsive and succinct
- Recommended range for animated durations is from 100ms to 600ms
- Striking a balance is key - slow enough to comprehend and fast enough to respect the customer’s time
- From Nielsen Norman Group research:
  - 100ms is perceived as instant. Users feel that they are directly causing something to happen on the screen
  - Delays between 100ms and 1 second gives users the impression that the website is working and causing the result to appear

### Easing
Cedar’s collection of easings are based on physics found in the natural world. They respond quickly when invoked and slow down over time to ease into their final position. This communicates a sense of physicality and reflects the customer's expectation of objects moving in the real world. Best used with any UI element that opens or closes, such as the accordion or modal components.

## Guidelines

Cedar motion is purposefully designed to enhance the customer's understanding of REI’s digital products. Components use animated interface patterns to reduce cognitive load and imbue a natural interactivity. It’s an important part of building customer trust and affinity for our products.

<hr>

### Use When

- Reducing cognitive load. For example, when a product image slides to reveal the next or previous product image after a user clicks on a directional arrow
- Attracting the user’s attention. For example, when a toast message moves down from the top browser bar for region-specific warning messages
- Providing context with transitions of a single object. For example, rotating an arrow icon to show an accordion panel opening and closing
- Showing continuity through the system with transitions between objects. For example, using animation to reveal a modal window
- Keeping users interested during loading or long processing times by providing delightful animations

<br>

### Don't Use When
- Adding the animation could waste the user’s time
- Entertaining the user, rather than helping them to accomplish their goals

<hr>

### Accessibility
- Do not cause the screen to flash more than three times a second
- For any animation that starts automatically and plays for more than 5 seconds, provide pause controls. For example, auto-updating content and ambient videos

<hr>

### Interface Patterns
#### Transitions
Use the transition pattern when:
- Moving users from one page to another page
- Transition out of one task to another
- Replacing large portions of information

<br>

<table class="table-first-col-align-top">
  <tr>
    <td style="width: 160px;"><strong>Accordion</strong></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><cdr-img class="cdr-doc-article-img" style="margin-bottom: 0" alt="Symbol for Accordion component" :src="$withBase(`/motion/pattern_symbol_accordion_1-1.png`)"/></td>
    <td>The arrow icon rotates using ease out timing with 300ms duration. <br/><br/> When opening, the Accordion content is revealed using the ease timing with 300ms duration. <br/><br/> When closing, the duration changes to 200ms to hide content. <br/><br/> When opening or closing, the panel content fades on and off using linear timing at 100ms. <br/><br/> View <a href="../../components/accordion/">Accordion</a> component.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br />

<table class="table-first-col-align-top">
  <tr>
    <td style="width: 160px"><strong>Tabs</strong></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><cdr-img class="cdr-doc-article-img" style="margin-bottom: 0" alt="Symbol for Tabs component" :src="$withBase(`/motion/pattern_symbol_tabs_1-1.png`)"/></td>
    <td>Ease out timing is used for updating the tab bar and revealing new content. <br/><br/> Duration was initially set at 600ms. During the development phase, the duration was updated to 500ms. <br/><br/> View <a href="../../components/tabs/">Tabs</a> component.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br/>

#### Supplements
Use the supplements pattern when:
- Bringing information on or off of the page without changing the user's location
- Adding or updating bits of additional content on the page

There are currently no components in the Cedar Design System that use supplemental animation.  Common examples of this type of animation are:
- Modals
- Popovers
- Tooltips

<br/>

#### Feedback
Use the feedback pattern when:
- Giving users direct feedback about their interactions
- Linking a human action to an interface's reaction
- Keeping the user interested during slow page-loading times

<br>

<table class="table-first-col-align-top">
    <tr>
      <td style="width: 160px;"><strong>Buttons</strong></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><cdr-img class="cdr-doc-article-img" style="margin-bottom: 0" alt="Symbol for Buttons component" :src="$withBase(`/motion/pattern_symbol_buttons_16-9.png`)"/></td>
      <td>When user hovers on or off, color changes instantaneously.  <br/><br/> View <a href="../../components/buttons/">Button</a> component.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<br />

<table class="table-first-col-align-top">
    <tr>
      <td style="width: 160px;"><strong>Breadcrumb</strong></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><cdr-img class="cdr-doc-article-img" style="margin-bottom: 0" alt="Symbol for Breadcrumb component" :src="$withBase(`/motion/pattern_symbol_breadcrumb_16-9.png`)"/></td>
      <td>When users hovers on or off, an underline style is applied to the link text.  <br/><br/> View <a href="../../components/breadcrumb/">Breadcrumb</a> component.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<br/>

#### Demonstrations
Use the demonstrations pattern when:
- Explaining how something works
- Showing a process through action, instead of telling what's happening

There are currently no animations on the REI site that are demonstrations. An example of this type of animation is when a group of files emerge from the downloads icon on the Mac dock interface.


<br/>

#### Decorations
Use the decorations pattern when:
- Creating an emotional connection between the interface and the user
- Sparking visual interest by keeping the user engaged
- Delighting a user's experience without conveying new information

There are no animations on the REI site that are decorative. For examples of decorative animations, view [15 Latest and Best Loading Animations to Make User Enjoy Waiting](https://hackernoon.com/u15-latest-and-best-loading-animations-to-make-user-enjoy-waiting-9c7861ed5d47).


<br/>
<hr>

### Creating New Motion Tokens
CSS animation frame rate for interface elements is dependent on the speed of the browser and computer:

- For animations running at less than 15fps, users will not be able to see continuous motion
- Most devices refresh their screen at 60 times a second

For smooth and responsive animation, use CSS attributes for:
- **Position:** Using transform property for `translate()`, to reposition an element in the horizontal or vertical directions
- **Scale:** Using transform property for `scale()`, to resize an element on 2D plane
- **Rotation:** Using transform property for `rotate()`, to rotate an element on x, y, or z axis
- **Skew:** Using transform property for `skew()`, to distort an element on the 2D plane
- **Opacity:** Specifies the opacity or transparency of an element with values from 0.0 - 1.0. Lower values cause the element to be more transparent
