## Overview

Component variables provide a versioned method for teams to:
- Import the exact CSS styles used in the Cedar Vue component
- Apply these exact CSS styles to elements in their project

Component variables are only available for a core subset of Cedar components, and are distributed in SCSS and LESS format.

## Examples

Component variables include: 
- Variables for specific properties such as `$cdr-button-base-border-radius`. This is the border-radius value for all Cedar button components
- Mixins such as `@include cdr-button-base-mixin` which sets many properties on an element. Each component has a `base` mixin which sets properties that apply to all components of that type, as well as `modifier` mixins which only apply to a specific variant of that component

For example, you can import the styling for a Cedar primary button component via a mixin:

```scss
.your-button-component {
  @include cdr-button-base-mixin;
  @include cdr-button-primary-mixin;
}
```

Or if you only need to apply some styles and not others, you can instead use individual variables:

```scss
.your-custom-button-component {
  border-radius: $cdr-button-base-border-radius;
  background-color: $cdr-button-primary-background-color;
}
```

Teams that are replicating specific Cedar components will want to use the mixins because they are easier to maintain. For example, if a future version of Cedar adds additional properties to an existing mixin, your application will inherit those changes when you update to that version of component-variables.

There are some cases where using individual component variables is preferable to using the mixins. For example, if you are using a 3rd party library or component and need to override some values but not others.


### Contract of Intent

Versioning
  - A versioned export of the exact styles being used in Cedar vue components
  - Whenever a major version of Cedar is released a corresponding major version of component variables will also be published
  - For minor or patch versions of Cedar, component variables will only be published if there were changes made to the distributed files
  - Outside of the Cedar release schedule, patch versions of component variables will only be issued if a bug is found in the distribution
  
Semantic naming
  - Component variables and mixins are semantically named based on the component being styled, how the style is intended to be used, and the CSS property being targeted
  - Teams must only use component variables and mixins when semantically appropriate
  
### Benefits

#### Brand Consistency on More Platforms
  - Component variables are an export of the exact CSS styles used in the Cedar Vue components
  - Ensures that core front-end components remain visually consistent across the co-op
  - Third party teams can easily consume the component variables to integrate the Cedar design system into their architecture

#### Ease of Maintainability
  - In the past, projects that could not consume Vue components had no way of using Cedar directly
  - Updates to the design system could not be pushed out to those projects unless they were implemented manually
  - With component variables and mixins, teams that are not using Vue can still stay in sync with the design system

<hr />

### Use When  
  - Your project does not use Vue.js, but you want to use Cedar
  - Your component must visually match an existing Cedar component, but not it's functionality. For example, a `vue-router` link component that looks like a CdrLink component
  - Your project requires the smallest possible bundle size, and your team is willing to take on the additional maintenance cost of using component variables instead of the Vue.js Cedar components

### Donâ€™t Use When
  - Do not use the component variables in a non-semantic way. For example, `cdr-button-base-border-radius` should only ever be used to style the border radius of a button element
  - Do not use component variables to publish clones or forks of existing Cedar components. Instead, work with the Cedar team to find a long term solution to support your use case

## Naming Structure

The naming structure for component variables and mixins is as follows:
  - **Namespace:** Top level namespace `cdr`
  - **Component:** Name of the Cedar component for the exported variable
  - **Modifier:** Variant of Cedar component for the exported variable
    - Base modifier (`base-`) indicates variables that apply to all instances of that Cedar component
    - Additional modifiers can be stacked on top of that
    - For example, to make a primary large button you would use the variables that have `base`, `primary`, and `large` modifiers
  - **Sub-Element:** Indicates a sub-element of a component. For example, `cdr-input-base-label-color` indicates the color of the label element used inside the input component
  - **CSS Property:** Describes the CSS property that this variable is applied to. If the property is listed as `mixin` then this is a mixin that should be included in this component
  - **State:** Describes the interactive state that this variable is applied to. These correspond to CSS selectors such as `:focus`, `:active`, `:hover`, `:disabled`, etc.

## Getting Started

For more information on installing and using component variables in your project, view the [README.md on GitHub](https://github.com/rei/rei-cedar-component-variables). Additional examples and a list of supported components are located on the [cedar-component-variables doc site](
https://rei.github.io/rei-cedar-component-variables/#/).  There is also a [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/qkwn78nw99) set up for testing out the component variables.
