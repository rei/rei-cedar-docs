## Adopting Cedar, Step-by-Step

The value of the design system is realized when products ship features using parts from the system.
The more Cedar is used, the better it will become, and will continue to grow and evolve with best practices and community contributions.

Teams adopt Cedar by developing a dependency on the system’s visual style and UI components, while dropping dependencies on redundant product-specific or external code for overlapping features.

### Adoption Models

Adoption of Cedar will vary by product team, as defined by the stage of the product in its life cycle and availability in the roadmap.

Some teams take a **‘Big Bang’** approach to quickly replace existing visual style and UI components completely with Cedar features in a couple of successive sprints.

Other teams may take a more **Incremental** approach, gradually adopting features over time. For those teams, adoption can progress across the following steps:

### Adoption Planning

For initial adoption, consider beginning with work on a new feature, section or redesign. Cedar components can be added incrementally to specific features or sections of a page, until the whole application can be converted to Vue.

Once familiar with the design system, teams can then begin to address accrued technical and design debt (including migration of Cedar 1 components) in other product areas that are not under active development.

### Contributions

The Cedar team welcomes contributions from the digital community at REI.

If you are interested in contributing design or code, please reach out at in Slack at [#cedar-user-support](https://rei.slack.com/messages/CA58YCGN4), email [cedar@rei.com](mailto:cedar@rei.com), or talk to your manager.

### Request a Component

The Cedar team will evaluate all new requests for components, beginning with a discovery process that includes an audit of visual patterns and weighs factors such as reusability across the product ecosystem (ideally can be used by 3-5 teams), investment and maturity of the product, and team bandwidth.

New feature and enhancement requests can be submitted using the [Feature Request Form](https://airtable.com/shrcbq9CHthuMO7AC).

### Report an Issue

The Cedar team is committed to maintaining consistent, quality components. If you encounter any defects in the Sketch UI Toolkit, Vue code, or on the documentation site, please submit a [Bug Report Form](https://airtable.com/shr3wSPCYQbycVx7i) and it will be added to the backlog.

The team will address the bug as soon as possible, depending on the severity of the issue and sprint capacity. Please include as much relevant information as possible when submitting a bug report to help prioritize, including steps to reproduce, urgency, and impact.

If you have a fix for the bug and would like to submit a PR for it, please reach out at in Slack at [#cedar-user-support](https://rei.slack.com/messages/CA58YCGN4) or email [cedar@rei.com](mailto:cedar@rei.com) to learn more about contribution opportunities.
