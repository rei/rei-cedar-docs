<p>Cedar is REI’s open-source Design System for digital products and experiences. Cedar includes the resources to create user interfaces consistent with REI’s <RouterLink to="/foundation/experience-principles/">experience principles</RouterLink>, brand styles, and best practices.</p>
<p>As a foundation for digital product development, the Cedar Design System provides a set of reusable components, style variables, design assets, and guidance for teams to efficiently build high-quality and accessible user interfaces.</p>
<p>Cedar is maintained by a core team of designers, developers, and writers that are dedicated to developing and supporting the system. Cedar welcomes collaboration with the REI digital community to help evolve the system to suit changing product needs.</p>
<h4 id="open-source" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#open-source">#</a> Open Source</h4>
<p>While Cedar is primarily focused on serving teams building experiences for REI, the system is also available as an open source project in GitHub and NPM.</p>

<h3 id="request-a-component" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#request-a-component">#</a> Request a Component</h3>
<p>All new requests for components will be evaluated, beginning with a discovery process that includes an audit of visual patterns. Factors such as reusability across the product ecosystem (ideally can be used by 3-5 teams), investment and maturity of the product, and team bandwidth are also taken into account.</p>
<p>New feature and enhancement requests can be submitted on <a href="https://rei.slack.com/messages/CA58YCGN4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#cedar-user-support<ExternalLinkIcon/></a> or during our weekly office hours.</p>
