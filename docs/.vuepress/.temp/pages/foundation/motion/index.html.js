      "cdr-duration-2-x": "Usage: Perceived as fast. Often used for hover or fading effects or icons that change shape, such as switching between a play button and a pause button.",
      "cdr-duration-3-x": "Usage: Perceived as normal. Often used for revealing content, such as the opening of a panel for the accordion component.",
      "cdr-duration-4-x": "Usage: Perceived as slow. Often used for revealing content on a tablet device because the screen is bigger than a phone or wearable device.",
      "cdr-duration-5-x": "Usage: Perceived as slower. Often used for icons with detailed animation, such as a ringing alarm clock or opening and closing a lock icon.",
      "cdr-duration-6-x": "Usage: Perceived as very slow. Often used for larger movement, such as revealing page content when switching tabs for the tabs component.",
      "cdr-timing-function-ease-out": "Specifies a transition effect that will feel responsive. This timing effect moves quickly at the beginning with a slow end. Use this animation when users expect an immediate response to their action such as clicking on an accordion or button.",
      "cdr-timing-function-ease": "Specifies a transition effect that is known as ease-in-out. This timing function can be quite satisfying for users because it has a slow start, a fast middle, and a slow end. Use this effect when users do not expect motion to occur. A suitable duration is 300-500ms for this timing function.",
      "cdr-timing-function-linear": "Specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end. Be cautious using this effect because objects in the real world donâ€™t usually move with a linear motion. Best for things like opacity fades."
