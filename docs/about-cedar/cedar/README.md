The Cedar design system promotes reusability of modular components to spread a more unified and cohesive customer experience across our enterprise of digital product development teams and enable more effective design communication.

### Community

The system is made by the core Cedar team & REI digital community, intended for use by all teams making web-based digital experiences.

Cedar has a core team of designers and front-end engineers that are dedicated to developing and supporting the system. There are also plans to incorporate contributions from the greater design and engineering community at REI as the system matures. Both the core Cedar team and individual Product teams will bear some costs of future development, as identified on an ongoing basis.

The Cedar team will be reaching out to individual product teams to discuss adoption strategy, assist with integration, and align roadmaps. Product teams should also feel free to reach out to the Cedar team proactively to discuss any questions, ideas, or share feedback.

In the spirit of creating a collaborative community around the design system, the Cedar team will also host sprint reviews and critiques that will be open to any interested parties, and participating in vertical team meetings for deeper dives into specific topics.
