## Compact

Reduced spacing around title and content body. Also, smaller font sizes resulting in an overall denser display of content.

<template slot="Design Guidelines">
<cdr-doc-table-of-contents-shell>

## Use when

- Providing users more content within the same layout
- Displaying content that's directly related, or supplemental, to the main subject of the page
- Designing with limited vertical space and there is enough content to condense

## Don't use when

- Linking a title to another page. Instead, use Link
- Designing with sparse content. Instead, use List or Paragraph
- Content is lengthy. Instead, use Tabs

## Foundations

- Always include a title, icon and subsequent content for each section. All are required
- Use on either light or dark backgrounds, background color is provided for use on both
- Never nest accordions within themselves

## Content

- Order the accordion titles by priority and importance
- Keep titles short to avoid wrapping at smaller viewports
- Use sentence case for titles

## Behavior

- Entire title area is clickable, including icon and background.
- Accordion sections are all closed by default, however it is possible to:
  - Open all accordion sections when page is displayed
  - Open a single accordion section with remaining accordion section closed
- Multiple sections can be open at the same time
- Sections do not automatically collapse when another is expanded
- Position interactive elements (i.e. Select, Button, Link) within the container far enough from the title area to avoid accidental collapsing
- Never nest accordions within themselves

<do-dont :examples="$page.frontmatter.nesting" />

- Use short titles for accordion labels to avoid wrapping

<do-dont :examples="$page.frontmatter.titles" />

## Responsiveness

- Accordion style can change variant based on breakpoint. Example: _Default_ at MD/LG, _Compact_ and _Border-Aligned_ at XS/SM
- Switching between tab component and accordion component is not supported in Cedar components library. Do not replace the accordion component with the tab component and different breakpoints

## Accessibility

To ensure that usage of this component complies with accessibility guidelines:

- Provide descriptive label for accordion header
- Be aware that embedding lengthy content in an accordion can be disorienting. When the accordion header expands, it can give the appearance of moving to another page

This component has compliance with WCAG accessibility guidelines:

- Providing keyboard interactions to:
  - Expand and collapse accordion headers
  - Navigate and reverse navigate through the accordion headers
- Generates ARIA tags for accessibility, specifically aria-controls, aria-expanded, and aria-hidden

</cdr-doc-table-of-contents-shell>
</template>

<template slot="API">
<cdr-doc-table-of-contents-shell>

Accordions are built from two components, `cdr-accordion` and `cdr-accordion-item`, which are meant to be used together.

## Properties

### cdr-accordion
<cdr-doc-api type="prop" :api-data="$page.frontmatter.versions[0].components[0].api.props" />

### cdr-accordion-item
<cdr-doc-api type="prop" :api-data="$page.frontmatter.versions[0].components[1].api.props" />

## Slots

#### cdr-accordion
<cdr-doc-api type="slot" :api-data="$page.frontmatter.versions[0].components[0].api.slots" />

#### cdr-accordion-item
<cdr-doc-api type="slot" :api-data="$page.frontmatter.versions[0].components[1].api.slots" />

## Installation

Resources are available within the [cdr-accordion package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rei/cdr-accordion);

<cdr-doc-api type="installation" />

- Component: `@rei/cdr-accordion`
- Component styles: `cdr-link.css`

To incorporate the required assets for a component, use the following steps:

### #1. Install using NPM

Install the `cdr-accordion` package using `npm` in your terminal:

_Terminal_

```terminal
    npm i -s @rei/cdr-accordion
```

### #2. Import Dependencies

_main.js_

```javascript
// import your required css
import "@rei/cdr-accordion/dist/cdr-accordion.css";
```

### #3. Add component to a template

_local.vue_

```vue
<template>
  <cdr-accordion>
    <cdr-accordion-item
      id="default-example"
      label="This is the label text"
    >
      This is the accordion content.
    </cdr-accordion-item>
  </cdr-accordion>
</template>

<script>
  import { CdrAccordion, CdrAccordionItem } from "@rei/cdr-accordion";

  export default {
    ...
    components: {
      CdrAccordion,
      CdrAccordionItem
    }
  }
</script>
```

## Usage

### Style

Use `cdr-accordion` to pass styling options to `cdr-accordion-item`.

```vue
<template>
  <cdr-accordion
    :compact="true"
  >
    <cdr-accordion-item
      id="item-1"
      label="Label text"
    >
      Accordion content here
    </cdr-accordion-item>
  </cdr-accordion>
</template>
```

### Behavior

Set `show-all` to `true` on `cdr-accordion`, and each `cdr-accordion-item` will display in an open state.

```vue
<template>
  <cdr-accordion
    :show-all="true"
  >
    <cdr-accordion-item
      id="item-1"
      label="Label text"
    >
      Accordion content here
    ...
```

`cdr-accordion-item` can also be controlled individually. If `show-all` is `false` at the `cdr-accordion` level, set `show` to `true` to display an individual accordion item in an open state. Note that `cdr-accordion` settings will take precedence over `cdr-accordion-item` settings.

```vue
<template>
  <cdr-accordion>
    <cdr-accordion-item
      id="item-1"
      label="Label text"
      :show="true"
    >
      Accordion content here
    ...
```

Any options set at the `cdr-accordion` level can be set on any parent component of `cdr-accordion-item` by using Vue's provide/inject functionality. This is useful, for instance, if `cdr-accordion-item` ever needs to be used as a part of another group component.


```vue
<template>
  ...
  <cdr-accordion-item
    id="item-1"
    label="Label text"
  >
    Accordion content here
  </cdr-accordion-item>
  ...
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    ...
    provide() {
      return {
        borderAligned: true,
        showAll: true
      };
    }
  }
</script>
```

## Accessibility

  - Provide a descriptive label for accordion header

This component has compliance with WCAG accessibility guidelines:
  - Providing keyboard interactions to:
    - Expand and collapse accordion headers
    - Navigate and reverse navigate through the accordion headers
  - Generate ARIA tags for accessibility, speciically aria-controls, aria-expanded, and aria-hidden
