# Overview


## Default (Medium)

Use for images with no responsive qualities.


<cdr-doc-example-code-pair :codeMaxHeight= false repository-href="/src/components/image" :sandbox-data="$page.frontmatter.sandboxData" >

```html

<cdr-img
  src="/rei-cedar-docs/live.jpg"
  alt="REI employees building trails during a stewardship event"
/>

```
</cdr-doc-example-code-pair>

## Managing Images

Apply rules to an image using ratio and crop properties. The below example is cropped using top alignment with the aspect ratio set as 9:16.


<cdr-doc-example-code-pair :codeMaxHeight= false repository-href="/src/components/image" :sandbox-data="$page.frontmatter.sandboxData" >

```html
<cdr-img
  src="/rei-cedar-docs/live.jpg"
  alt="REI employees building trails during a stewardship event"
  ratio="9-16"
  crop="top"
  cover
/>
```
</cdr-doc-example-code-pair>

## Displaying Images as Backgrounds

Use the cover property to resize the background image to fill the entire container.


<cdr-doc-example-code-pair :codeMaxHeight= false repository-href="/src/components/image" :sandbox-data="$page.frontmatter.sandboxData" >

```html
<cdr-img
  src="/rei-cedar-docs/live.jpg"
  alt="REI employees building trails during a stewardship event"
  ratio="16-9"
  cover
  crop="top"
/>
```

</cdr-doc-example-code-pair>


## Shaping Images

Apply a radius to an image.

### Rounded
The below example is cropped using center alignment with the aspect ratio set as square and the radius set as rounded.


<cdr-doc-example-code-pair :codeMaxHeight= false repository-href="/src/components/image" :sandbox-data="$page.frontmatter.sandboxData" >

```html
<cdr-img
  src="/rei-cedar-docs/live.jpg"
  alt="REI employees building trails during a stewardship event"
  ratio="square"
  radius="rounded"
  crop="y-center x-center"
/>
```

</cdr-doc-example-code-pair>

### Circle
The below example is cropped using center alignment with the aspect ratio set as square and the radius set as circle.


<cdr-doc-example-code-pair :codeMaxHeight= false repository-href="/src/components/image" :sandbox-data="$page.frontmatter.sandboxData">

```html
<cdr-img
  src="/rei-cedar-docs/live.jpg"
  alt="REI employees building trails during a stewardship event"
  ratio="square"
  radius="circle"
  crop="y-center x-center"
/>
```

</cdr-doc-example-code-pair>

### Error Event Handler

CdrImg will bind any event handlers to the `img` element that it wraps. This is intended to support attaching an error handler function in case an image does not load, but can be used for any HTML/JS event. Note that because images are usually not "interactive" elements you should not bind click handlers to them.

<cdr-doc-code-snippet :copy-button="false" :line-numbers="false">

```html
<cdr-img
  src=""
  @error="eventHandler"
/>
```

</cdr-doc-code-snippet>

## Lazy Loading

The CdrImg component accepts any valid HTML `img` attribute. CdrImg works with [native lazy loading](https://css-tricks.com/native-lazy-loading/) by setting the `loading` attribute.

<cdr-doc-example-code-pair :codeMaxHeight= false repository-href="/src/components/image" :sandbox-data="$page.frontmatter.sandboxData">

```html

<cdr-img
  src="/live2.jpg"
  alt="REI employees building trails during a stewardship event"
  loading="lazy"
/>

```
</cdr-doc-example-code-pair>

## Accessibility

To ensure that usage of this component complies with accessibility guidelines, provide descriptive text for `alt` attribute for:
- Informative images:
  - Convey a simple concept or information
  - For more information, [Web Accessibility Tutorials: Informative Images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/informative/)
- Functional images:
  - Initiate an action, rather than to convey information (such as a printer icon)
  - Describe functionality of the link or button, rather than the visual image
  - For more information, [Web Accessibility Tutorials: Functional Images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/functional/)
- Images of Text:
  - Displays text that is intended to be read
  - Avoid text in images, unless the image is a logo
  - Text alternative should contain the same words that appear in the image
  - For more information, [Web Accessibility Tutorials: Images of Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/textual/#image-of-styled-text-with-decorative-effect)

<br/>

This component has compliance with WCAG guidelines by:
- Adding an empty `alt` attribute into the image element by default
- An empty `alt` attribute is needed to meet accessibility requirements for decorative images

# Guidelines

## Use When

- Illustrating a product feature
- Allowing comparisons between similar items
- Capturing the user’s attention
- Telling a story
- Communicating the REI brand message
- Explaining a complex procedure or how to perform an action

## The Basics

REI image requirements are described on the [Launch and DefaultShop Image Sizes](https://confluence.rei.com/display/CMA/Launch-and-DefaultShop-Image-Sizes) page.

### Aspect Ratio

Use conventional aspect ratios:

- Square
- Portrait: 1:2, 2:3, 3:4, 9:16
- Landscape: 2:1, 3:2, 4:3, 16:9

### Quality

- Always maintain high image quality
- Choose the right file format when saving your images to ensure proper image quality and file size:
  - For photos, use JPEG. Optimize JPEG files to find a balance between size and quality
  - For bitmap/raster artwork, use PNG with 8-bit color palette

### Sizing

- Avoid small file sizes that pixelate the image
- Avoid unnecessarily large file sizes. Export images at the lowest file size possible without compromising quality
- Optimize high resolution images using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/)
- Must display images at a proper pixel size compared to natural size

### Color and Contrast

- Test images for high contrast displays
- Ensure that no meaning is lost when colors are removed
- Include text only with sufficient contrast

### Cropping Images

- Specify the ratio of all cropped images
- Enable background image to use the entire container:
  - Without stretching the image
  - Cropped either vertically or horizontally without empty space
- Crop images by specifying the starting point:
  - Adjust the starting background position on the x-axis of the image:
    - Left: Orients the image to its horizontal left
    - Right: Orients the image to its horizontal right
    - X-center: Orients the image to its horizontal center
  - Adjust the starting background position on the y-axis of the image:
    - Top: Orients the image to its top
    - Bottom: Orients the image to its bottom
    - Y-center: Orients the image to its vertical center
- Accepts x and y axis combination (e.g. crop="top left")

<cdr-img class="cdr-doc-article-img captioned" :src="$withBase(`/image-component/Spec__Image_Crop_Top_16-4.png`)"/>
Images are cropped on y-axis with top value and on x-axis with left, x-center, and right values


<cdr-img class="cdr-doc-article-img captioned" :src="$withBase(`/image-component/Spec__Image_Crop_Center_16-4.png`)"/>
Images are cropped on y-axis with y-center value and on x-axis with left, x-center, and right values

<cdr-img class="cdr-doc-article-img captioned" :src="$withBase(`/image-component/Spec__Image_Crop_Bottom_16-4.png`)"/>
Images are cropped on y-axis with bottom value and on x-axis with left, x-center, and right values


## Content

### File Names
- Image file name should include primary keyword or what the page is targeting
- Showcase keyword targeting through file name and alt text
- For more information, view SEO How-to article [Image Implementation](https://confluence.rei.com/display/SI/Image+Implementation)

### Overlaid Text

- Only display heading text on non-solid backgrounds:
  - Text should be at least 18px
  - Never allow overlaid text to wrap. Longer strings of text can be harder to navigate when the background varies
  - Consider adding a semi-transparent black gradient over the image in the CSS
- Apply only vertical gradient backgrounds. Avoid horizontal, diagonal, and radial gradients
- Always include a backup background color so that when the background image is disabled, text is still legible and passes contrast requirements
- For help in determining whether your text and image combination conforms to the required contrast ratio, use the [Color Contrast Analyzer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/color-contrast-analyzer/dagdlcijhfbmgkjokkjicnnfimlebcll) Chrome plugin

### Decorative Images

- Avoid using decorative images; instead present the image as a background image using CSS
- If using the HTML `<img>` element, add:
  - An empty `alt` attribute
  - Attribute ` role="presentation" `

### Alternative Text

- Use [this decision tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/) to determine how to use the `alt` attribute
- Be succinct. Ideally, one sentence or less
- Be informative and accurate
- If images of text are used, the `alt` attribute should contain the same words that appear in the image
- Avoid repetitive labels. For example: “image of” or “picture of”
- Descriptions:
  - Use short description that conveys the essential information presented by the image without burdening users with unnecessary details
  - Use long descriptions for complex images, such as graphs, charts, or diagrams, to provide enough information
- For groups of images that convey a single piece of information, apply the `alt` attribute to only one image for the entire group
- For image maps with multiple clickable areas:
  - Must provide an overall context for the set of links using `alt` attribute
  - Each individual clickable area should have an `alt` attribute that describes the purpose or destination of the link

## Responsiveness
- Ability to control image display at small, medium, and large breakpoints
- Lazy loading of images is provided
- The `srcet` and `sizes` attributes can be used to control which image loads at which screeen size

## Resources

- Chrome plugin, [Color Contrast Analyzer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/color-contrast-analyzer/dagdlcijhfbmgkjokkjicnnfimlebcll)
- Image compression service, [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/)

# API

## Props

This component will bind any attribute that a [native HTML img element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) accepts.

<cdr-doc-api type="prop" :api-data="$page.frontmatter.versions[0].components[0].api.props" />


## Slots

<cdr-doc-api type="slot" :api-data="$page.frontmatter.versions[0].components[0].api.slots" />

## Usage

### Ratio

- Positions the original image asset off-screen and replaces it with a background image
- CSS background property value is set to `contain` which resizes the background image to make sure it is fully visible
- Shrinks the image and display additional padding to the requested ratio
- To manipulate background property and remove excess padding:
  - Use `cover` property
  - Use `crop` property
  - Use both `cover` and `crop` properties together

### Cover

- Resizes the background image to cover the entire container
  - Without stretching the image
  - Cropped either vertically or horizontally without empty space
- Requires the `ratio` property

### Crop

- Background image is displayed in its original size
- Requires the `ratio` property
- Defines the starting point of the overflow position
- Accepts a single x-axis and y-axis value (e.g. ` crop=”top left” `):
  - Adjust the starting background position on the x-axis of the image:
    - `left`: Orients the image to its horizontal left
    - `right`: Orients the image to its horizontal right
    - `x-center`: Orients the image to its horizontal center
  - Adjust the starting background position on the y-axis of the image:
    - `top`: Orients the image to its top
    - `bottom`: Orients the image to its bottom
    - `y-center`: Orients the image to its vertical center

### Radius

- Variants for this property: `circle` or `rounded` (for rounded rectangle)
- Uses preset values provided in `cdr-core.css`

### Modifiers

Following variants are available to the `cdr-img` modifier attribute:

| Value | Description            |
|:------|:-----------------------|
| 'responsive'  | Sets the image to display block and 100% width |

## Performance

For internal applications with large images or images that would benefit from changes due to platform or breakpoint, use the `loading="lazy"` property to lazy load the images. The `srcset` and `sizes` properties can also be used to load the optimal image size for the user's screen. CdrImg supports any attribute that a native `img` element accepts, see the [MDN img docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) for more information on the `loading`, `srcset`, `sizes`, and other properties.
