## Cedar Utility Classes

The Cedar utility classes have been deprecated. Any future work should instead make use of [Cedar tokens](../../tokens/all-tokens) and plain CSS to apply the same styles, and teams currently using the utility classes should incrementally migrate away from them. Please reach out in the [#cedar-user-support](https://rei.slack.com/messages/CA58YCGN4) Slack channel if you have any questions.
