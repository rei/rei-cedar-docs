# Overview

## Default

Caption aligns to the left alongside the body copy with inset padding. Default caption includes summary and credit.

<cdr-doc-example-code-pair repository-href="/src/components/caption" :sandbox-data="$page.frontmatter.sandboxData" >

```html
  <cdr-caption
    summary="Testing and validating the final fit of the 2018/2019 Tecnica ski boot collection during the September 2017 focus group in Park City, Utah."
    credit="Image Credit: Blizzard Tecnica"/>
```

</cdr-doc-example-code-pair>

## Summary

Summary has same CSS styles as the default; however, only the summary element is displayed.

<cdr-doc-example-code-pair repository-href="/src/components/caption" :sandbox-data="$page.frontmatter.sandboxData">

```html
  <cdr-caption
    summary="Testing and validating the final fit of the 2018/2019 Tecnica ski boot collection during the September 2017 focus group in Park City, Utah."/>
```

</cdr-doc-example-code-pair>


## Credit

Credit has same CSS styles as the default; however, only the credit element is displayed.

<cdr-doc-example-code-pair repository-href="/src/components/caption" :sandbox-data="$page.frontmatter.sandboxData">

```html
  <cdr-caption
    credit="Image Credit: Blizzard Tecnica"/>
```

</cdr-doc-example-code-pair>


## Caption with Image

The captions component is text-only; however, it is meant to be displayed in the context of a media object.

<cdr-doc-example-code-pair repository-href="/src/components/caption" :sandbox-data="Object.assign({}, $page.frontmatter.sandboxData, { components: 'CdrCaption, CdrImg' })" >

```html
<figure>
  <cdr-img src="http://via.placeholder.com/350x150"/>
  <figcaption>
    <cdr-caption
    summary="Testing and validating the final fit of the 2018/2019 Tecnica ski boot collection during the September 2017 focus group in Park City, Utah."
    credit="Image Credit: Blizzard Tecnica"/>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

```

</cdr-doc-example-code-pair>


## Accessibility

To ensure that usage of this component complies with accessibility guidelines, do the following:

- Use captions sparingly and only with accompanied media
- Do not use caption text styles for body copy; it is smaller than the recommended size for text readability

<br/>

This component has compliance with WCAG guidelines by:

- Using text color with a Level AA contrast ratio of 4.5:1 contrast between the text color and the background but only when displayed on light backgrounds

<hr>

# Guidelines

## Use When

- Providing further context and attribution to any figure or media asset such as an image, video or chart

## Don’t Use When

- Displaying body copy. Instead, use [Paragraphs](../paragraphs/)
- Breaking up the text styles in a layout for aesthetic purposes

## Content

The Captions component has two separate fields: Summary and Credit.
  - While they often appear together, one is not dependent on the other
  - Both are, however, dependent on media content (image, video, etc)

\
Text fields within a caption:
  - Summary text gives the media context:
      - Keep summary text concise, 1-2 lines at LG breakpoint
      - Use sentence case
  - Credit provides attribution to the correct sources:
      - Helps users gauge the strength and validity of the material the author has used
      - Begin credit text with “Video Credit” or “Image Credit”

## Anatomy

- Captions align to the left border based on the paragraph container and not centered under the media object
- Max width is 498 pixels, even if the media (image, video, or chart) extends beyond the paragraph max width
- Left padding is added to the caption container
<br />
<br />
<cdr-img :src="$withBase(`/caption/spec_caption_layout-4-3.png`)"/>
<br />

### Types of Accreditations

For photos submitted by customers or members:
  - Provide first name, initial of last name (not full last name)
  - If available, social site handle from where the asset was provided
  - For example, Madeline G. @maddyluv

\
For multiple photo accreditations:
  - List in clockwise order from top
  - Separated by commas and semicolons
  - No breaking spaces
  - For example, “Image credits: top left, Madeline G. @maddyluv; top right, Kevin C.; bottom right, George M. @gmonkey”

\
For purchased assets (photos or video):
  - Use full name, provided there a signed release is on file

\
For copyrighted media (photos or video):
  - Use © symbol and date separated by (non-breaking) spaces and photographer name. (e.g. © 2017 Norm Bellows)
  - If date is not available, use © symbol and photographer name separated by a (non-breaking) space. (e.g. © Norm Bellows)

  - NPR Training, Storytelling tips and best practices: [These are NPR's photo caption guidelines](http://training.npr.org/visual/these-are-nprs-photo-caption-guidelines)


## Behavior

### Do / Don’t

Keep summary content short to avoid excess text-wrapping.
<br/>
<br/>
<do-dont :examples="$page.frontmatter.summaries" />

Captions must be accompanied by media asset such as an image, video or chart.
<br/>
<br/>
<do-dont :examples="$page.frontmatter.media" />

Summary and Credit serve different purposes and should remain separate.
<br/>
<br/>
<do-dont :examples="$page.frontmatter.separate" />

Caption stays left aligned with body copy regardless of the width of the media.
<br/>
<br/>
<do-dont :examples="$page.frontmatter.align" />

# API

## Props

<cdr-doc-api type="prop" :api-data="$page.frontmatter.versions[0].components[0].api.props" />

## Usage

The **CdrCaption** component is developed to work within a composition with other components; however composition-type components have not been developed yet.

<br />

The below example demonstrates how to extend this component for use within a figure.

```vue
<figure>
  <cdr-img src="http://via.placeholder.com/350x150" />
  <figcaption>
      <cdr-caption
      summary="Testing and validating the final fit of the 2018/2019 Tecnica ski boot collection during the September 2017 focus group in Park City, Utah"
      credit="Image Credit: Blizzard Tecnica”
    />
  </figcaption>
</figure>
```
