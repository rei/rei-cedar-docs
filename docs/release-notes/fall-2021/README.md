## Update Steps

- Update to the latest version of the Cedar packages:

| package name | version |
|--------------|---------|
| `@rei/cedar` | ^11.x.x |
| `@rei/cdr-tokens` | ^10.x.x |
| `@rei/cdr-component-variables` | ^7.x.x |
| `@rei/cedar-icons` | ^2.2.0 |

- If your project depends on any shared component packages (i.e, FEDPACK, FEDCOMP, FEDPAGES), you will want to update those packages to the new version of Cedar before updating your micro-site.
